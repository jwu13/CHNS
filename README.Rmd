## Summary

Our package helps researchers explore [China Health and Nutrition Survey](https://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/data) With just a basic knowledge of R, the users can access a wide variety of information regarding effects of the health, nutrition, and family planning policies on the health and nutritional status of its population. \

The package includes two data set that includes individual-level survey data of 10 specific years over the period of 1989 - 2015.\

There are currently three functions inside the package:\

- `real_income`: takes in a numeric year value and returns a data frame with real income adjusted for inflation.\

- `num_of_children`: takes in a numeric year value and returns a data frame with child births, child deaths, and total children up to the input year.\

- `map_income`: takes in a numeric year value and returns a map of China with province-level average annual income mapped on the surveyed provinces.\

This package would be a useful tool for social science researchers interested in policy analysis in China. Additionally, it is also an easy tool for data analysis and visualization for anyone interested in CHNS.


## Installation

You can install the development version of CHNS from [Github](https://github.com/jwu13/CHNS) with:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jwu13/CHNS")
```

You can load this package by
```{r}
library(chns)
```

For `map_income()` function in the package, you need to install and load the package leafletCN.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("leafletCN")
library(leafletCN)
```

## Data Sets Included

- `indinc_10_clean`: A data set that includes 88166 survey data entries from 1989 - 2015 with Individual ID, survey year, and nominal individual income.
- `emw_12_clean`: A data set that includes 26616 survey data entries from 1989 - 2015 with Individual ID, survey year, number of child died and number of child births for women.
- `map_dat_clean`: A simple data set with province-level average annual income, survey year, province names in both English and Chinese, and categories of income that is used for mapping.

### Basic usage of functions

- Example 1: Calculate the real income

This is a basic example for `real_income()` that returns a data frame with income weighted with CPI for the selected base year.

```{r}
real_income(base_year=1989) 
```

- Example 2: Calculate Number of Children a Women has

This is an example for `num_of_children()` that returns a data frame with number of child births, number of child deaths, and number of total children of women included in the dataset up to the input year.

```{r}
num_of_children(year = 2006) 
```

### Data Visualization

- Example 3: Get a map to get an overview of province-level average income.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
map_income(year = 2011)
```
